In the current context of the Covid-19 pandemic, many patients are taken to the intensive care unit (ICU), which is why the number of people suffering from post-ICU syndrome has increased, WHO stressed the importance of services specialized and comprehensive rehabilitation (physical, psychological and cognitive rehabilitation) for patients who have undergone ICU.

In this work, a solution is proposed that allows the rehabilitation of adult patients with post-ICU syndrome at home and addresses this problem in a semi-integral way (psychological and physical / pulmonary), emphasizing respiratory rehabilitation. The proposal consists of a virtual platform (mobile App) interconnected with two monitoring devices, the app will be a means of help for the rehabilitation of the patient with the characteristic of being intuitive, in this you will have the option of entering as a patient or doctor.

Upon entering as a doctor, the information and progress of the patients being monitored will be displayed and the exercise routine can be modified according to their progress. When entering as a patient there are 3 areas, in the area of physical exercises those that have been previously chosen by the doctor from an audiovisual repository will appear, in the area of respiratory exercises you can link the app with the rehabilitation device to take data which will be stored in the cloud and the psychological area that will have questionnaires to evaluate the quality of life of the patient. The rehabilitation device consists of a flow inspirometer added with sensors for the automation of data collection and transmission.

The vital signs device will be for the measurement of saturation, heart rate and temperature, to assess the patient's condition during rehabilitation exercises.
The present technological development for remote rehabilitation is justified, considering that post-ICU patients would have difficulties to go to rehabilitation therapy in a health establishment.
